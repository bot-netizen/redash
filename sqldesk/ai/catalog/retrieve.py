Finding the few tables a question is about.

Ranked by what the query log says, not by name: the tables people use are the
tables people ask about. BM25 and embeddings come later -- and only once the
eval set can say they earned their dependency. Usage frequency does most of
the work, which is why the harvester comes first.
