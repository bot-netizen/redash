"""
Sending a dashboard to the people who asked for it.

Two jobs. One runs every minute and asks which subscriptions are due; the
other sends one of them. Separate because a send draws a page in a browser and
mails several people, which is seconds of work, and the minute-by-minute job
has to stay quick enough to be run every minute.

What is sent is the latest **stored** results, and the email says how old they
are. Refreshing every query first would turn a subscription into a warehouse
bill nobody asked for; an owner who wants fresh numbers gives the queries a
schedule.

Nothing here raises at the caller. A subscription that cannot be sent records
why on itself -- the owner sees it on the dashboard -- and the next one is
tried. One broken dashboard must not stop the other nineteen going out.
