"""
The clock on uploaded files.

Three steps, cheapest and most reversible first:

1. **Unload** a file nothing has queried for three days. No view is created
   for it, so every query on that data source stops paying for its schema
   inference. The file is untouched and the next query naming it brings it
   back. Nobody is told, because nothing was lost.
2. **Warn** the uploader a day before expiry, with a button that keeps the
   file. This is the step that makes step 3 acceptable.
3. **Delete** what was warned about and not kept.

The ordering is the policy. An upload is the only copy of itself, so the only
deletion that happens without a person involved is one that was announced in a
mail somebody could act on -- and if the mail could not be sent, the file is
not deleted.
