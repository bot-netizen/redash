    A dashboard is a streaming one or an ordinary one, never both.

    Not tidiness. A dashboard has a **single refresh interval**: a stream panel
    wants two seconds and a warehouse panel wants thirty or more. Mix them and
    the choice is between running every warehouse query behind the board every
    two seconds -- a dashboard that quietly hammers a warehouse all day -- and
    showing a stream that is half a minute stale, which is the one thing a
    stream exists not to be.

    A textbox belongs on either.

    Measured against the dashboard's declared `kind` rather than against
    whatever happens to be on it already. The old rule let the first widget
    decide, which meant the refusal could only ever arrive at the *second* one
    -- after somebody had built half a board. Now an empty dashboard already
    knows what it is, and the message can say so.
