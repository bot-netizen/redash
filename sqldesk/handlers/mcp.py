"""
The HTTP end of the MCP server, and its audit.

Streamable HTTP rather than stdio: stdio means the server runs on the machine
the client runs on, and the whole point here is that SQLDesk is somewhere
else -- a cluster, a VM, a container. One POST endpoint carrying JSON-RPC,
which is what a remote MCP client speaks.

Authentication is a SQLDesk API key in the Authorization header: a credential
the user already has, which already identifies a user, so every permission
check downstream is the one the rest of the application makes.

Every request is recorded, including the ones refused before anyone was
identified. Those are the rows worth having.
