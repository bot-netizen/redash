"""
Who gets a dashboard mailed to them, and when.

Everything here needs the `send_dashboards` feature, which an install only
offers where a renderer is configured -- there is nothing to send without a
picture.

Two rules run at save time rather than at send time, because both are
somebody's mistake and both are cheaper to say now than to discover in twenty
inboxes a week later:

- the dashboard has to be small enough to send as one page, and
- a recipient has to be able to see the dashboard. One who cannot is left off
  and named in the reply, rather than silently dropped or silently mailed
  something they have no right to.
