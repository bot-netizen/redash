"""
Folders for dashboards, and the lock that makes one mean something.

A folder says what belongs in it. A **locked** folder is one only
administrators can change: the dashboards inside it cannot be edited, renamed,
archived or have a widget added by anybody else, including whoever made them.
That rule lives in `permissions.can_modify`, where every one of those four
paths already goes, rather than in these handlers -- a lock that covered three
of the four would be worse than no lock.

What is here is the folders themselves, and moving a dashboard between them,
which is the one act the lock cannot be enforced from the other side: taking a
dashboard *out* of a locked folder has to be an administrator's decision too,
or the lock is a doorway with a sign on it.
