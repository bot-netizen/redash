"""
A stream's own settings: what it keeps, what it groups by, and whether it
stays on when nobody is looking.

Everything a stream *reads* comes through its data source like any other --
the query editor, the schema browser, permissions. What is here is the handful
of decisions that are only a stream's, and the page that shows what it is
doing.

Reading is for anybody who may use the data source. Changing is for an
administrator: a pin burns a worker and a disk indefinitely, a row budget
decides how much disk, and a rollup definition decides what a chart can ask --
none of those are a reader's to set.
