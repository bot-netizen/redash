"""
Querying a stream: SQL over the window SQLDesk is holding.

A topic is a data source, so it has to answer the two questions every data
source answers -- what tables are here, and run this SQL -- and both are
answered from the stream's own DuckDB file rather than from Kafka. Kafka has no
query interface and SQLDesk is not going to pretend otherwise: what you can
query is the window, which is what the chart says above itself.

Two tables, deliberately:

- `events`, the raw window. Minutes of it, however many the row budget buys.
- `rollup`, per-minute buckets going back a day, read from Postgres through a
  view so one query can join "now" to "this morning" without two data sources.

The connection is the stream's store, locked down the same way an upload's is:
a stream's SQL is written by people, so DuckDB's defaults would be theirs.
