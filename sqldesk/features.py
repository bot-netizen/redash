"""
The things an administrator can hand to a group, in one list.

A *feature* here is different from the dozen permissions every group is born
with. Those describe the ordinary work of the application -- writing a query,
making a dashboard -- and every group has them. A feature is something an
administrator decides a particular group may do: reach the warehouse from an
AI client, curate what that client is told, keep an uploaded file past its
expiry. Nobody has one until somebody says so.

Adding a feature is one entry below. The grant endpoint will accept it, the
Group page will draw a checkbox for it, and `can()` will answer for it.

`enabled` is what decides whether an install offers the feature at all: there
is no sense showing "Connect AI clients" where MCP is switched off. A feature
that is off is not grantable and `can()` says no, whatever a group's row
happens to hold -- so turning MCP off takes the ability away rather than
leaving it granted and inert.
