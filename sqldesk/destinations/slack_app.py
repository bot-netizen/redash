"""
An alert to Slack through the app, which can carry the picture.

The existing Slack destination posts to an incoming webhook. A webhook cannot
upload a file, so an alert sent that way says a threshold was crossed and shows
nothing -- which for an alert on a chart is most of the information missing.
This one posts as the app installed under Settings → Slack, so it can upload
the pictures the alert was told to attach and put them in the message.

Both exist on purpose. A webhook needs nothing set up beyond a URL and works
where nobody wants to install an app; this needs the app and gives you the
picture. Replacing the webhook one would break every alert already using it for
a feature not everybody wants.

What it does **not** do is take a token of its own. The token is the
organisation's, entered once by an administrator and stored encrypted; a
destination that carried its own would mean a bot token in a form field on a
page anybody with alert permissions can reach.
