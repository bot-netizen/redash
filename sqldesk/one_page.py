"""
Whether a dashboard is small enough to send as one page.

A subscription arrives in somebody's inbox. A dashboard of eighty widgets
arrives as an eleven-page PDF nobody opens, or a picture so long that every
chart on it is a smudge -- so past one page the answer is "too big", said when
the subscription is saved rather than discovered by twenty recipients a week
later. It is asked again before each send, because a dashboard grows after
somebody has subscribed to it.

**There is a second copy of this rule**, in
`client/app/pages/dashboards/export/index.js`, which answers the same question
about the dashboard on the page for the Export button. That one measures the
rendered grid; this one works from the stored layout, because there is no
browser here. They have to agree, and `tests/test_one_page.py` pins the
numbers against the file that holds them so a change to either is a failing
test rather than a surprise in somebody's email.
