"""
What a query will cost, before a model runs it.

A model exploring a warehouse writes queries nobody reviewed. Most are cheap;
the expensive ones are expensive in a way that shows up on a bill or on
somebody else's dashboard, and by the time either happens the model has moved
on. So `run_query` can be given a ceiling, and the estimate it is checked
against is **the engine's own** -- not a guess from the SQL.

That restriction is the whole design. A cost model of our own would be a second
opinion about a question the engine answers authoritatively, wrong in ways
nobody could predict, and it would have to be written again for every one of
thirty-five connectors. Here there are two estimates and they are both free:

- **Postgres and its family** give a plan cost from `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)`.
  The number is in arbitrary units -- "cost of a sequential page fetch" is 1.0
  -- so a ceiling is a figure somebody arrives at by looking at their own
  queries, not one we can default usefully. Comparable across queries on one
  database, which is all it needs to be.
- **BigQuery** gives bytes from a dry run, which is exactly what it bills for.

Every other engine is unaffected: no estimate means no refusal. That is
deliberate rather than a gap -- refusing on a number we had to invent would be
worse than not refusing.
