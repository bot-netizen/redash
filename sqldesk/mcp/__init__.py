"""
An MCP server, on the SQLDesk server.

The 0.6 plan said this would be a separate optional container, on the
reasoning that kept the screenshot renderer out of the image. That reasoning
was about Chromium -- 400MB nobody who turns the feature off should carry.
MCP is JSON-RPC over HTTP and adds no dependency at all, while a separate
process would need its own copy of the permission model, its own database
connection and its own deployment. So it lives here, and the argument for
splitting it out can be made again the day it needs something heavy.

The tools are task-shaped rather than CRUD-shaped: `find_context` answers a
question in one call, where a `list_tables`/`get_schema` pair makes a model
issue forty and wander. Retrieval happens here, with the catalog, not in the
model's context window.

Every call runs as the SQLDesk user whose API key was presented, and every
data source access goes through the same `has_access` the rest of the
application uses: reading the catalog needs what viewing a dashboard needs,
running SQL needs what the editor needs. There is no service account.
