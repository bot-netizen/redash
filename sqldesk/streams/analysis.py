"""
What a topic looks like, before anybody commits to keeping it.

Somebody choosing which topics to enable needs three things, and none of them
can be guessed from the name: what the messages contain, how fast they arrive,
and what that means for how much history a window will hold. Enabling a topic
blind and finding out an hour later that it is JSON we cannot parse, or that it
is so fast everything will be sampled, is the experience this exists to avoid.

**It reads the last few messages, not the next few.** Watching the end of a
topic for three seconds tells you nothing about a topic that produces once a
minute -- which is most of them -- so this seeks *backwards* from the high
water mark and reads what is already there. The rate comes from the timestamps
on those messages, which is the rate they were actually produced at rather than
the rate they happened to arrive while somebody had a page open.

Python parses the sample. The rule about not decoding messages in Python is
about the ingest path, where it runs for every event for ever; this runs once,
over at most a few hundred, because somebody pressed a button.
