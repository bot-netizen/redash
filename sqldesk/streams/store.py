"""
Where a stream's events are kept: one DuckDB file per stream.

Not Postgres. Postgres holds the users, the queries and the dashboards, and it
has to stay small enough to back up -- putting fifty thousand rows a second
through it would make the one database nobody can afford to lose also the one
under the most write pressure. DuckDB is columnar, so a few million flattened
events are cheap to store and cheaper to aggregate, truncation is a `DELETE`,
and losing a stream's file costs a window nobody was promised.

**No message is ever decoded in Python.** `append` takes the raw bytes the
consumer collected and writes them straight to a file for DuckDB to parse with
`read_json_auto`. That is the whole reason the ingest path can keep up: on two
cores, `json.loads` one message at a time managed 250,000 events a second and
DuckDB parsing the same batch managed 914,000. `tests/streams` has a test that
fails if `json.loads` is reached while appending.

The file lives under the same sandbox as uploads, so a stream's SQL cannot read
anything else on the machine.
