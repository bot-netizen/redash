The shape this replaces had one topic per data source, which meant a ticket to
an administrator for every topic somebody wanted to look at. Now an
administrator registers the cluster once and the topics enabled on it are its
tables -- so **enabling a topic is the real access decision**, and that is what
the streams permission guards.
