"""
The consumer loop, driven by a fake broker that hands back bytes.

Kafka itself is behind one class; everything above it -- the sampling decision,
the flush, the window, the rate, the schema -- is here, and none of it needs a
broker. What a broker would add is confidence that librdkafka behaves as
`Broker` assumes, which is a different test and needs one running.
