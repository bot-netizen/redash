"""
A ceiling on what a model's query may cost.

The estimate is always **the engine's own**. A cost model of ours would be a
second opinion about a question the engine answers authoritatively, wrong in
ways nobody could predict, and it would need writing again for each of
thirty-five connectors. So: a plan cost from Postgres, bytes from a BigQuery
dry run, and silence everywhere else.

The rule these tests exist to hold is **no answer is never a refusal**. An
engine with no estimate, a ceiling nobody set, an EXPLAIN that failed: all of
them let the query run. Refusing on a number we had to invent would be worse
than running an expensive query.
