/*
  Where the router learns what paths exist.

  The pages somebody lands on are imported here directly, so they are in the
  first download. Everything else is behind a `*.routes.jsx`, which registers
  the paths and fetches the page when somebody goes to it -- see
  `client/bundle-budget.js` for what that is worth, and
  `services/routes.registration.test.js` for the list of paths this has to
  produce either way.
