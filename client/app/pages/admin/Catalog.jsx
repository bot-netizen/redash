            A plain link rather than a fetch: the browser handles the file,
            the session cookie authenticates it, and nothing has to hold the
            zip in memory to hand it straight back. Absolute, like every
            /api/admin/ path in the admin pages: those routes are registered
            at the root only, not per organization. (The data source list
            this page loads is per organization, so that one is relative.)

            `download` is load-bearing, not decoration. The app puts a click
            handler on the whole body and turns any anchor into a client-side
            route -- so without it the router swallowed this click, pushed
            /<org>/api/catalog/export, and drew its own "page cannot be
            found" over a download that had in fact already succeeded.
            handleNavigationIntent skips anchors carrying it.
