/*
  What the workers have in flight, and the one button that ends it.

  It was a panel at the bottom of the overview, which is the wrong place for
  two reasons. It is read while somebody is waiting -- so it wants to refresh
  far more often than table sizes and an hour of aggregated events do -- and it
  is the only page in this section with an action on it, which should not be
  something you scroll past four panels of figures to reach.

  Fifteen seconds rather than the overview's minute. Short enough that a query
  that has just ended stops being offered a Kill button; long enough that
  leaving the page open is not itself load.
