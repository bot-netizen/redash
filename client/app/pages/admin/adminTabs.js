/*
  The Admin section, in one list.

  Two things draw it -- the dropdown in the navbar and the tab strip on the
  pages themselves -- and they had drifted: Storage and Streams existed as
  pages and routes for days with no way to reach either, because the two menus
  were written out by hand in different files and nobody updated both.

  Each tab carries a `description` as well as a title. An administrator opening
  this section for the first time is usually there because something is wrong,
  which is the worst moment to be guessing which of seven pages holds the
  number they want. The dropdown shows the first line of it; the page shows all
  of it under the tabs.
