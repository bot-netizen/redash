  Streaming is a property of a query, not a place in the application.

  with the others under `/queries/streaming`; a streaming dashboard is a
  dashboard, under `/dashboards/streaming`; which of a cluster's topics may be
  queried is a setting on the connection, under Settings. What is left here is
  the editor itself and the redirects for the URLs people have already sent
  each other.

  The stream editor *is* the query editor.

  A stream query written on a page of its own would get no visualizations, no
  parameters and no way onto a dashboard -- all of which hang off a query. So
  it is one, and this is the same page with `streamsOnly`: a picker offering
  only clusters, a button that says Start streaming, and no result ever stored.

  It keeps its own path because a streaming query has only this one page.
  Nothing it produces is stored, so there is no saved result for a view page to
  show -- `Query#getUrl` sends every link to one here.

  Where the old paths went.

  Both were in a menu, so both are in somebody's history and in whatever
  anyone pasted into a chat. A redirect costs one route each; a 404 costs
  somebody the assumption that the page was removed.

  `/streams/running` has no destination of its own any more. What was consuming
  and how many slots were left is now part of Admin -> Streaming Queries, which
  also holds the budgets, and the count that mattered to everybody else -- "all
  the slots are in use" -- is on the editor's status strip, where it is read at
