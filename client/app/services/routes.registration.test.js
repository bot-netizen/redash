/*
  Every path the application answers, in one list.

  Splitting a page into a lazily loaded chunk means moving its
  `routes.register` call out of the page module and into a `*.routes.jsx` that
  is still imported at startup. Forget one and the page is simply gone: the
  router has no path for it, the SPA falls through to its not-found page, and
  nothing fails at build time or in any other test. This is the test that
  fails.

  Add a line when you add a page. Change one only when you mean to change a
  URL somebody may have bookmarked.
